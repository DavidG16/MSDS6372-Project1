## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Original analyses from looking at the data.
##change column names, change to factors
##luxury, performance set to a number
## market.category, driven_wheel, model, engine.fuel/type, Model

##The column names are either too much or not enough.  Change the column names so that they do not have ##spaces, underscores, slashes, and the like. All column names should be under 12 characters. Make sure ##you're updating your codebook with information on the tidied data set as well.
